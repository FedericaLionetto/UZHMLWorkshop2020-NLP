    "### 3.2 - Sentiment analysis using VADER\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is the field of NLP that aims at understanding the sentiment of a certain portion of text. One of the best-known packages for sentiment analysis is the open-source package VADER, which is part of NLTK.\n",
    "\n",
    "The official description of VADER reads\n",
    "\"VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.\"   \n",
    "VADER is built on social media text but it is in general applicable to other domains, including customer reviews.  \n",
    "VADER is based on a lexicon (vocabulary) that is validated by multiple human judges according to a well-defined and standard procedure. Each word in the lexicon is associated with a sentiment valence, consisting of two properties, polarity and intensity. The polarity describes if the text is positive/negative. The intensity describes how much the text is positive/negative, on a scale from -4 to 4. Words not included in the lexicon are classified as neutral. \n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the sentiment of a sentence or list of sentences, VADER looks for words in the text that are part of the lexicon, modifies the intensity and polarity of the identified words according to a series of rules, sums up these values and then normalises to the range [-1,1].  \n",
    "VADER incorporates emojis (for example \":-)\"), acronyms (for example \"LOL\") and slang (for example \"nah\"). The algorithm differs from a Bag of Words approach as it takes words order and degree modifiers into account, e.g. by increasing/decreasing the intensity of the sentiment.   \n",
    "For example, the sentences:\n",
    "- \"This flight was great.\", \n",
    "- \"This flight was really great.\" \n",
    "- \"This flight was really GREAT.\"\n",
    "- \"This flight was really GREAT!\"\n",
    "- \"This flight was really GREAT! :-)\"  \n",
    "would have an increasing intensity, triggered by degree modifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the sentiment analysis is a series of scores, namely \"compound\", \"pos\", \"neu\" and \"neg\".  \n",
    "The compound score is normalized between -1 (extremely negative) and 1 (extremely positive) and is a good metric if we need a single value that summarises the sentiment of a given sentence. The compound score can also be used to classify sentences into positive, neutral and negative by setting an appropriate threshold on the compound score. The official recommended threshold is:\n",
    "- positive sentiment, compound score >= 0.05\n",
    "- neutral sentiment, compound score <= 0.05 and >= -0.05\n",
    "- negative sentiment, compound score <= -0.05  \n",
    "\n",
    "The positive, neutral and negative scores represent the fraction of the sentence that has a positive, neutral and negative sentiment. The sum of these three scores should sum up to 1. The positive, neutral and negative scores are a good metric if we need multiple values that summarise the sentiment of a given sentence."

My flight from LHR was delayed so I missed the connection in Istanbul. Most ground staff donâ€™t speak English, and I was given contradictory instructions from those that could speak a little English. I eventually got on a flight to Izmir three hours later, but it wasnâ€™t an easy process, made worse by the vast distances one has to walk between gates in the cavernous new airport. Also, Iâ€™d phoned a TK call centre (based in Ukraine) to pay an extra Â£40 or so each way for extra leg room seats. However, as the departure times kept changing, my seats kept changing, and for the return leg to London from Istanbul I was not given an extra leg room seat. Luckily there was a spare exit row seat and the cabin crew sorted me out. Overall, I think their cabin crew and planes are very good, ground staff and call centre staff need better training and they all need better computer systems and software to work with.'"

The vectors of the numerical representation correspond to the words that appear in the preprocessed text of the customer reviews. The values in the numerical representation correspond to the occurrences of the specified word in the customer review. To avoid to end up with too many features in the numerical representation, we limit the dictionary to the words that appear at least a minimum number of times in the customer reviews. This threshold is specified through the parameter `min_df` of `CountVectorizer`.  \n",

 - In a browser page, open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
 - If needed, log in with your Google Account and select the tab "Github" from the prompt menu. Search for "UZHMLWorkshop2020-NLP".
 - In order to test the environment that will be used throughout this workshop, access and execute the TestEnvironment.ipynb notebook.
   This will download the data and allow you to import the helper functions in the notebook.
 - Make sure this worked and report if any troubles arise.

## Data

## Prepare for the tutorial

 - In a browser page, open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
 - If needed, log in with your Google account and select the tab "GitHub" from the prompt menu. 
 - Search for the repository "UZHMLWorkshop2020-NLP".
 - In order to test the environment that will be used throughout this tutorial, access and execute the "TestEnvironment.ipynb" notebook.
   This will allow you to check that you can correctly import the helper functions into the Jupyter notebook.
 - Make sure this works and report if any troubles arise.

## Download the data

You do not need to download the data directly as the download is done automatically in the Jupyter notebooks.

## Run the Jupyter notebooks of the tutorial

- The tutorial consists of four Jupyter notebooks.
- In a browser page, open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- If needed, log in with your Google account and select the tab "GitHub" from the prompt menu. 
- Search for the repository "UZHMLWorkshop2020-NLP".
- Access and execute the Jupyter notebooks in sequential order, starting from "CustomerReviews_1_DataPreparation.ipynb". 
- When prompted, insert the authorization code provided by Google. This is needed to correctly set up a shared storage that can be accessed by multiple Jupyter notebooks, so that you can save the output of a Jupyter notebook to one file and then read it back from that file using a different Jupyter notebook.

During the tutorial, we will need a Google account connected to Google Drive. For this reason, you might consider the option of creating a new Google account for this tutorial.

## Preparing for the tutorials: follow the steps below to setup the IPython notebook

 - In a browser page, open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
 - If needed, log in with your Google Account and select the tab "GitHub" from the prompt menu. Search for "UZHMLWorkshop2020-NLP".
 - In order to test the environment that will be used throughout this workshop, access and execute the "TestEnvironment.ipynb" notebook.
   This will allow you to import the helper functions in the notebook.
 - Make sure this worked and report if any troubles arise.

## Data

You don't have to download the data directly as the download is done automatically in the notebook.

## How to run the other IPython notebooks

- In a browser page, open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- If needed, log in with your Google Account and select the tab "GitHub" from the prompt menu. Search for "UZHMLWorkshop2020-NLP".
- Access and execute the notebooks in sequential order, starting from "CustomerReviews_1_DataPreparation.ipynb". 
- When prompted, insert the authorization code provided by Google. This is needed to correctly set up a shared storage that can be accessed by multiple notebooks, so that you can save the output of a notebook to one file and then read it back from that file using a different notebook.
